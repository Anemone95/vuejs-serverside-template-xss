# Vue.js serverside template XSS example

TODO: What is this?

## Running the demo

1.  Install [docker & docker-compsoe](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
1.  Run the demo

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

1.  Open <http://localhost:8080> in your browser

If you don't want to bother with `docker` you can throw the `index.php` file on
a php capable server and host it there. Keep in mind that this file is
vulnerable to XSS by design, you should run this on a local environment.
